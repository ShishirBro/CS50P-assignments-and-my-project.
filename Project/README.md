# Analyzing Historical Precipitation Data: Uncovering Time Series Insights

#### Video Demo: <URL https://youtu.be/iHszRs7leYg>

#### Description:
This project develops a Python application that fetches, processes, and visualizes historical precipitation data using the NASA POWER API. The application aims to provide insights into precipitation trends over a specified period and geographical location.

**Functionalities:**
- **Data Fetching:** The application fetches daily corrected precipitation data from the NASA POWER API, which provides reliable and granular weather data globally.
- **Data Processing:** After fetching the data, it is converted into a pandas DataFrame to facilitate easier handling and operations.
- **Data Visualization:** The application generates a time series plot of the daily corrected precipitation, allowing for visual analysis of precipitation trends.
- **Data Storage:** Finally, the processed data is saved to a CSV file, enabling further analysis or reporting.

**Project Files:**
- **main.py:** Contains the main script that orchestrates the fetching, processing, visualization, and saving of the data.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists all the necessary Python packages for the project, ensuring that all dependencies are met.

**Usage:**
To run the application, ensure you have Python and the required packages installed. Execute the script and follow the on-screen prompts to enter latitude, longitude, start date, and end date for the data you wish to analyze.

**Design Choices:**
- **Pandas for Data Handling:** Chosen for its robustness and ease of use in data manipulation and analysis tasks.
- **Matplotlib for Visualization:** A widely used library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Requests for API Calls:** A simple HTTP library for making API requests. Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling HTTP requests.

**Challenges & Resolutions:**
- **Error Handling:** Initially, the application did not handle API request failures. This was rectified by implementing robust exception handling to ensure the application remains resilient and user-friendly.
- **Data Volume:** The application may handle large volumes of data depending on the date range specified. Optimization was achieved by refining data processing steps to ensure efficiency.

This project not only showcases the ability to work with APIs and data processing libraries but also serves as a practical tool for meteorologists, researchers, and anyone interested in historical weather patterns.
